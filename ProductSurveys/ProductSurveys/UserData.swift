     MARK: -               Publisher-Subscriber Design Pattern
     ===============================================================================
     | Publisher:   @Published var under class conforming to ObservableObject      |
     | Subscriber:  Any View declaring '@EnvironmentObject var userData: UserData' |
     ===============================================================================
    
     By modifying the first View to be shown, ContentView(), with '.environmentObject(UserData())' in
     SceneDelegate, we inject an instance of this UserData() class into the environment and make it
     available to every View subscribing to it by declaring '@EnvironmentObject var userData: UserData'.
    
     When a change occurs in userData (e.g., deleting a country from the list, reordering countries list,
     adding a new country to the list), every View subscribed to it is notified to re-render its View.
     ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
     NOTE:  Only Views can subscribe to it. You cannot subscribe to it within
            a non-View Swift file such as our CountryData.swift file.
     ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    // Publish countriesList with initial value of countryStructList obtained in CountryData.swift
